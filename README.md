Cute 3DS Capture is a 3DS capturing software for linux (and possibly Mac OS X, although this is not yet tested). It is written in C++ and uses [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).

# How to compile

# How to use

It was a play on words when I first tried to design a capture software with Qt (which is prononced "cute"). Although I didn't say with Qt, I liked the name.
